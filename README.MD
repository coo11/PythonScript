# My Python Learning Practice

### Add right-click context menu “Windows Terminal Here”

![](AddTerminalToContextMenu/View.png)

> Inspiring from this repository [*PowerShell Scripts to Install/Uninstall Context Menu Items for Windows Terminal*](https://github.com/lextm/windowsterminal-shell), I rewrote it in Python so that I can directly convert script into executable file without installing Powershell 7.

- Since packaged it into an exe file, you can directly [DOWNLOAD](https://github.com/coo11/PythonScript/releases/tag/v0.0.1) it and no need to install any dependencies.
- It works well in the Administrator account in Windows 10 2004 64-bit but running in other environment is not considered.
- If you installed this script and add new command-line interface to Windows Terminal, Just reinstall this script.
- After Installation if icons are blank, you should rebuild icons cache.
